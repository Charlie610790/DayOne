Day One

This was my first project at the Iron Yard.  I haven't looked at HTML or stylesheets in over 5 years and this is what I remembered pretty much before starting this class.  It is a basic/simple one page site with my likes/dislikes from my first time using a Mac in this class.

Tools Used:<BR>
HTML, CSS<BR>

Below is a screen shot of the page designed.<BR>
